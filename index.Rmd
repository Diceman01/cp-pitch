## An age-old problem

It's inevitable - people will ask you how old you are.   You will wonder how old you are.   You will wonder if **that** much time has really passed.   Well, wonder no more.   [This app](https://diceman01.shinyapps.io/ddp-course-project/) will be able to tell you exactly how old you are - in years, months or days.   Imagine that!

## How old are you in years?

1. Enter your date of birth in the ```date of birth``` field.
1. Do nothing else.   The app will tell you your age in years.


For instance, if you were to set your date of birth to 01 January 2000, the app would tell you that you are:
```{r}
dob <- as.Date("2000-1-01")
ty <- Sys.Date()
as.POSIXlt(ty)$year - as.POSIXlt(dob)$year + if(as.POSIXlt(ty)$mon - as.POSIXlt(dob)$mon < 0){-1} else {0}
```

## How old are you in months?

1. Enter your date of birth in the ```date of birth``` field.
1. Select months from the ```units``` drop down.   

The app will tell you your age in months.

## How old are you in days?

1. Enter your date of birth in the ```date of birth``` field.
1. Select days from the ```units``` drop down.   

The app will tell you your age in days.
